# Python Compiler Test Cases

This document contains the following test cases to validate the Python compiler:

1. **Happy Case**: Checks for correct addition operations.
2. **Sad Case**: Tests handling of division by zero.
3. **Bad Case**: Intentionally contains a syntax error to check compiler error handling.

Run each test case and observe the behavior to ensure the compiler is functioning as expected.
